            "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to generate 20 questions based on signal processing, each fitting into one of the four specified types. Hmm, let me start by understanding each question type thoroughly.\n\nFirst, let me recap the four types:\n\n1. Graph with Multiple-Choice Equations: I have to provide a graph's time and amplitude data, and then four equations where one is correct. The user picks the right equation that matches the graph.\n\n2. Equation with Multiple Corresponding Graphs: I'll give an equation and four graphs, and the user selects the correct graph.\n\n3. Graph with Multiple Energy Values: Show a graph and four energy values, the user picks the correct one.\n\n4. Equation with Multiple Energy Values: Provide an equation and four energy values, user selects the correct one.\n\nI also have examples of basic signal functions and example equations to reference. Let me review those:\n\nBasic functions include rect, tri, u (unit step), ramp, delta. Examples provided are x1 to x12, which are various combinations, including shifted and scaled versions.\n\nEach question needs to be generated randomly. Since the example had a specific format for each type, I should follow that structure.\n\nI should make sure that each of the 20 questions is unique and the correct answer is among the choices. Also, I need to ensure that the JSON is properly formatted without any mistakes.\n\nI'll plan to divide the 20 questions evenly among the four types, so 5 each. Let me start by creating a question for each type.\n\nFor the first type, Graph with Equations. Let's say I choose x1(t) = 2 * rect(2t - 1). The graph would have time points where rect(2t-1) is non-zero. So, rect(2t -1) is 1 when |2t -1| <= 0.5 → t is between 0.25 and 0.75. So amplitude is 2 during that interval, 0 otherwise.\n\nI can create a time array from, say, 0 to 1 in steps, and amplitude accordingly. Then, the equations could be similar to x1(t) but with changes, like different scaling or function types.\n\nWait, but the example uses four equations, so I need to generate four, with one correct. Maybe vary scaling, shifts, or function type. For example:\n\n- 2*rect(2t - 1) – correct\n- 2*rect(t - 1)\n- tri(2t)\n- 2*u(t)\n\nI need to make sure each equation is different but plausible.\n\nFor the Equation with Graphs type, say x(t) = sin(πt) * rect(t/2). The rect(t/2) is 1 for |t| <=1. So the sine function is active between -1 and 1. The graphs should show a sine wave in that interval and zero elsewhere. The other graphs might show different intervals or waveforms.\n\nEach graph can have a time and amplitude array. Perhaps I can create four different plots, like the correct one, and three incorrect ones with variations like different shapes or active intervals.\n\nGraph with Energy: I need to compute the energy of the signal from the graph. Energy is the integral of the square of the amplitude over time. So, for a graph with time and amplitude, I can sum the squares of the amplitude values multiplied by the time step to estimate energy.\n\nThe correct energy is this computed value. The other options are plausible but incorrect, perhaps differing by calculation errors or decimal places.\n\nEquation with Energy: For a given equation, I can compute its energy analytically. For example, x(t) = sin(4πt) has an energy of 0.5 over a certain interval since it's a sine wave. But I need to make sure the interval is correctly considered. Then, four options include the correct value and three distractors.\n\nI think I should start by creating each question, ensuring each has unique aspects. Maybe number them and then compile them into JSON.\n\nWait, but to ensure uniqueness, I might have to vary the signals each time, using different functions, scaling, shifting, etc.\n\nAlso, for each question, I'll need to generate the time and amplitude arrays appropriately. Perhaps using numpy to generate the signals and then converting to lists, but since this is a manual process, I'll have to do it step by step.\n\nFor example, for the first question:\n\nType 1: Graph with Equations.\n\nLet me pick a signal, say x(t) = rect(t). So, from t=-0.5 to t=0.5, amplitude is 1. Else 0.\n\nTime array from -2 to 2, steps of 0.5: [-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]\n\nAmplitude array: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0\n\nThen, equations could be:\n\n1. rect(t)\n2. tri(t)\n3. u(t)\n4. 2*rect(2t)\n\nSo the correct index is 0.\n\nThat's one question. I can create similar ones by varying the function, scaling, and shifts.\n\nI think I can rotate through the different signal functions and combinations to generate all 20 questions, ensuring each is unique and the correct answer is properly set.\n\nFor the energy questions, I'll calculate the energy correctly and then create distractors that could result from miscalculations, like using amplitude instead of square, or wrong integration limits.\n\nNow, let me proceed to generate the 20 questions, ensuring each type occurs 5 times, randomly ordered."
